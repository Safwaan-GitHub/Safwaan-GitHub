## About Me

Hey there! I'm diving deep into the world of C programming. I have solid fundamental knowledge and am practising to get better daily.

As I navigate through the intricacies of low-level programming, I am fascinated by the complexities and security aspects of software development. My repositories are a playground where theory meets practice. From intricate C projects like `So_Long: Death's Collection` to exploring algorithms in `Push Swap` and mastering file management with `Get Next Line`, every commit reflects my journey toward mastering systems programming.🛡️🚀

## My Projects

- **[So_Long: Death's Collection](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/so_long)**: A 2D puzzle-adventure game where strategy meets storytelling, all powered by the MiniLibX graphics library. 🎮👾
- **[Pipex](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/PipexSolution)**: A inter-process communication that replicates the process of bash pipes!
- **[Push Swap](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/push_swap)**: The ultimate sorting challenge, where I manipulate data structures with the least amount of moves possible. 💾🔄
- **[Get Next Line](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/GNLSUB)**: A project that showcases my understanding of buffering and optimized file reading in C. 📂📖
- **[Ft_Printf](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/ft_printf)**: My take on recreating the classic `printf` function, focusing on precision and reliability. 🖨️🔍
- **[Libft](https://github.com/Safwaan-GitHub/Libft)**: Libft, a arsenal of functions that can be used anytime anywhere.
